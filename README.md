## Blogify
Name's all you've gotta know
-> I'll make this my personal website as well (or at least contain a page with a 'ABOUT ME' section...)!

## Why tho?
This will also work as my -personal- blog page to chitchat, research and expand on topics of my interest.
Also it's cool to have a introductory web page.

## What will I learnk with this?
Working with AI, TailWindCSSl, etc. to build my very own blog engine.
(Planning on inserting some kind of AI interaction).

Since this project is using [], this also means it's a full stack implementation.

## Current Topics I wanna talk 'bout
- Our path to AI, from expert systems to sophisticated "thinkers"
- Succession of processes, is there a better way to order them?
