## Blogify
Name's all you've gotta know
-> I'll make this my personal website as well (or at least contain a page with a 'ABOUT ME' section...)!

## Why tho?
This will also work as my -personal- blog page to chitchat, research and expand on topics of my interest.
Also it's cool to have a introductory web page.

## What will I learnk with this?
Working with AI, TailWindCSSl, etc. to build my very own blog engine.
(Planning on inserting some kind of AI interaction).

Since this project is using *[Next.JS]*, this also means it's a full stack implementation.

## Current Topics I wanna talk 'bout
- Our path to AI, from expert systems to sophisticated "thinkers"
- Succession of processes, is there a better way to order them?
- MCP (Model Context Protocol): Use cases, SDK tutorial and examples.
- My experiences and a list of useful resources to learn topics related to CS, Software Engineering, Computer Networks and more!

# Deployment
Next.js' template seems to have some association with Vercel, so I'm planning on deploying the blog there (as of now).
